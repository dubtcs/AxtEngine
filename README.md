AxtEngine - Abstract Engine

That's the best name I could come up with.

Using TheCherno's game engine series, *Game Engine Architecture, By Jason Gregory*, and LearnOpengl.com as guides, this was created to learn how game engines work and better my understanding of graphics.

Run GENERATE.bat to create VS2022 solution and project files, open AxtEngine.sln and build.
